Diabetes is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases worldwide, and its early detection is critical for effective 
management and prevention of complications. With the rapid growth of data-driven healthcare, machine learning has 
become a powerful tool to predict diabetes risk by analyzing both clinical and demographic factors. In this project, a 
Random Forest model was developed to predict the likelihood of diabetes using features such as HbA1c level, blood 
glucose level, age, BMI, and lifestyle indicators. The model achieved an accuracy of 97%, demonstrating its strong 
predictive capability. To bridge the gap between technical analysis and practical use, the trained model was deployed as a 
web application, allowing users to input their health parameters and instantly obtain a prediction. This project highlights 
the potential of integrating machine learning into healthcare by providing an accessible, accurate, and scalable solution for 
early diabetes risk assessment, which can be applied in real-world industry and clinical settings.
