            This web application is designed to raise awareness about diabetes and provide
            an easy way to estimate your risk. Our mission is to empower people with
            knowledge and encourage healthier lifestyles.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our goal is to make early risk assessment accessible to everyone using
            modern data science techniques. While this app gives useful insights,
            it is not a substitute for professional medical advice. Please consult
            your healthcare provider for any medical concerns.
